## Why Transition from GoogleScraper?

While GoogleScraper has been a valuable tool for many users, several limitations have led to its decline:

1. **Outdated Technology**: GoogleScraper relies on Python and Selenium, whereas modern scraping leverages tools like Puppeteer with Node.js for superior performance and compatibility.
2. **Inefficient HTTP Scraping**: Scraping directly on the HTTP protocol level is less effective due to advanced anti-bot mechanisms.
3. **Lack of Scalability**: Handling large-scale scraping tasks in the cloud or across distributed systems is challenging with GoogleScraper.
4. **Buggy Performance**: The project has become increasingly prone to bugs, making maintenance difficult.

To address these challenges, the community now focuses on more modern tools like [SE-Scraper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/se-scraper), a JavaScript library built on Puppeteer.
