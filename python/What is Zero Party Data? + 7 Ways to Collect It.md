## What is Zero Party Data?

Zero-party data refers to information that consumers voluntarily and proactively provide to brands. Coined by [Forrester](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/straight-from-the-source-collecting-zero-party-data-from-customers/) in 2018, this data includes details such as preferences, purchase intentions, personal context, and how customers want to interact with a brand.

### How is Zero Party Data Different from First Party Data?

[First-party data](https://emotive.io/blog/what-is-first-party-data-here-s-why-it-matters) is information businesses collect directly from their customers through behavioral tracking, such as purchase history, website interactions, and customer service transcripts. 

Zero-party data is a subset of first-party data but differs in that it is intentionally shared by the customer. For example, filling out a preference survey or providing an email address to subscribe to a newsletter are examples of zero-party data.

### Examples of Zero Party Data

Here are some examples of zero-party data you can collect:

- Customer preferences (e.g., favorite products or styles)

## Why is Collecting Zero Party Data Important?

### 1. Enhances Personalization
[Personalization](https://getstream.io/blog/ecommerce-personalization/) is crucial for engaging modern shoppers. Zero-party data allows businesses to tailor messaging and offers to customer preferences, resulting in higher engagement and conversion rates.

For instance, if you sell board games, you can ask customers about their preferences when they subscribe to your newsletter. Based on their answers, you can send personalized recommendations for family-friendly games or mystery-themed games.

---

### 2. Provides Valuable Customer Insights
Zero-party data gives businesses insights into the *why* behind customer behavior, something behavioral data alone can't provide. This qualitative feedback can shape product development, marketing strategies, and overall business direction.

### 3. Reduces Reliance on Third-Party Cookies
With [Google](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/01/building-more-private-web-path-towards.html) and [Apple](https://www.apple.com/privacy/control/) phasing out third-party cookies, zero-party data offers a sustainable way to create a comprehensive customer profile without relying on third-party tracking.

---

### 4. Builds Trust Through Transparency
Collecting zero-party data requires customer consent, fostering trust between your brand and your customers. When customers voluntarily share their information, personalized campaigns feel less intrusive and more authentic.

## 7 Effective Ways to Collect Zero Party Data

### 1. Use Product Recommendation Quizzes
Interactive quizzes help customers find products tailored to their needs while giving you valuable insights into their preferences. For example, [ThirdLove](https://www.thirdlove.com/pages/fitting-room#get_results) uses a quiz to gather details about customersâ€™ bra sizes and style preferences, enabling personalized recommendations.

---

### 2. Gather Details During Signup
When customers sign up for emails or SMS notifications, use opt-in forms to ask a few targeted questions, such as their gender, location, or preferences. Avoid overwhelming users by limiting the form to one or two additional questions.

---

### 3. Send Customer Surveys
Use tools like [SurveyMonkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/) or [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/) to create surveys and collect customer feedback. These insights can guide product development, improve customer experience, and refine your marketing strategies.

---

### 4. Use Conversational Popups
[Conversational popups](https://www.octaneai.com/blog/introducing-conversational-pop-ups) engage customers in real-time, helping them navigate your website while collecting data. For example, an exit-intent popup could ask questions about what customers are searching for or offer product suggestions.

---

### 5. Post-Purchase Questions
After checkout, ask customers a quick question about their shopping experience. This could include how they discovered your brand or suggestions for improving your website.

---

### 6. Request Product Reviews
Encourage customers to leave product reviews. These reviews not only provide valuable feedback for improving your offerings but also increase trust among potential buyers. Follow up with an email or text after purchase to request reviews.

---

### 7. Create a Preference Center
Allow customers to update their profile information in a preference center. This can include demographic details, preferred communication frequency, and specific content interests, like new product launches or blog updates.
