## 2. Selenium

Selenium is a widely-used library that mimics human interactions with web pages. It can handle dynamic content by interacting with JavaScript and performing actions like clicking buttons or filling out forms.

### Pros:
- Excellent for scraping dynamic web pages.
- Supports multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).

### Cons:
- Slower than headless scraping solutions.
- Resource-intensive.

### Example:
Selenium is great for scraping websites that require user interactions, such as filling forms or navigating through dynamic menus.

## 3. Requests

Requests is a lightweight library that simplifies HTTP requests. Itâ€™s ideal for beginners who want to scrape static web pages without worrying about complex setups.

### Pros:
- Easy to use and fast.
- Great for accessing APIs or static content.

### Cons:
- Cannot handle JavaScript-rendered content.
- Limited for complex scraping needs.

### Example:
Requests makes it easy to send a `GET` request and parse the response. Combine it with BeautifulSoup for added functionality.

## 4. BeautifulSoup

BeautifulSoup is a popular library for parsing HTML and XML documents. It is excellent for extracting specific data points from web pages using selectors and navigable trees.

### Pros:
- Intuitive and beginner-friendly.
- Flexible for handling various formats (HTML, XML).

### Cons:
- Requires integration with other libraries (e.g., Requests).
- Slower than some alternatives for large-scale scraping.
