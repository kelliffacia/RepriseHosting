# Python Web Scraping Libraries & Tools â€“ Top Picks for 2025

Web scraping is an essential skill in today's data-driven world. Based on my decade of software development experience, including my role as CTO at AIMultiple, where I led data collection from over 80,000 web domains, I've compiled the best Python libraries and tools for web scraping. Below, you'll find an overview of each tool's features, benefits, and challenges, along with recommendations tailored to your scraping needs.
